She was married at an early age, as was customary in her culture, and faced the challenges of starting a new life with grace and determination. Despite the difficulties, she embraced her responsibilities wholeheartedly. It wasn't until she was 19 years old that she got to experience the joy of traveling in a vehicle for the first time. Over the years, her spirit of curiosity and adventure led her to explore multiple countries, gaining wisdom and experiences that enriched her life.
